# Wooliesx Tech Challenge

Hi, I'm Dwight Mowbray and this is my tech challenge solution. It's built on React and Redux, with some example unit tests.

To run the app:
* `git clone https://github.com/greenwebdev/wx-tech-challenge.git`
* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To run tests:
* `yarn test`
